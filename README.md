# Evergreen Repo
This repo is a portfolio of past and current work, just including projects of interest. 

# Guide:
- `groundwater_analysis`: contains all relevant files for the Groundwater Analysis notebook. Including shapefiles and .csv. Note that the .shp file was too large so I couldn't upload it.
- `groundwater_quality_analysis.ipynb`, `groundwater_quality_analysis.py`: The EDA and statistical analysis of the Ground Water dataset found in the folder above.
- `groundwater_utils.py`: All functions used in the Ground Water Analysis.
- `landsat_sandbox`: This is an informal space for my landsat work. The files I used are found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/reymaster/hwsd-landsat-processed). This isn't super clean code, it's mostly for trial and error and exploration.
    - `landsat_sandbox.ipynb`, `landsat_sandbox.py`: The notebook and .py file for my exploration.
    - `landsat_utils.py`: Utils file housing functions used in the notebook.
